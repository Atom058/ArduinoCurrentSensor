# ArduinoCurrentSensor
This is a simple current sensor for Arduino. The results are somewhat accurate, approximately 1-4 LSB, depending on range

#basic workings:
This is the basic logic
* External current is passed through a sense resistor. (preferably 1 Ohm)
* The measured voltage is compared to a reference voltage
* The reference voltage is generated by a TL431 or similar. Currently arround 1.250 V.
* The voltage i transfered to a current readout and displayed on 3x 7 Segment display

#Amplification:
There is an amplificaiton funciton built in through a LM317, with two available ranges.
Through calibration with an external multimeter, the linear transformation funcitons were established
